## Installation and documentation

Documentation for Mac [is available
here](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/).

## Building the Docker Toolbox

Toolbox installers are built using Docker, so you'll need a Docker host set up. For example, using [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine):

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox toolbox
$ eval "$(docker-machine env toolbox)"
```

Then, to build the Toolbox for both platforms:

```
make
```

Build for a specific platform:

```
make osx
```

or

```
make windows
```

The resulting installers will be in the `dist` directory.
