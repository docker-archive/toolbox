# Docker Toolbox Overview

Docker Toolbox is an installer for quick setup and launch of a Docker environment on older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet the requirements of the new [Docker for Mac](/docker-for-mac/index.md) and [Docker for Windows](/docker-for-windows/index.md) apps.

Toolbox includes these Docker tools:

* Docker Machine for running `docker-machine` commands

* Kitematic, the Docker GUI

* a shell preconfigured for a Docker command-line environment

* Oracle VirtualBox
